- low prio
	* whenever i say packed scene, could instead be: add to tree -> show(), hide()

	- pause screen implementation
		- packed scene instance -> set process to stop except itself + music
		- if button clicked -> play icon + sound for a while (timer) -> process, queue_free()
	- options volume implementation
		- options_menu.gd -> _on_save_options_pressed()
		- get music & sound volume values from children -> apply
	- buttons hover textures
		- quick fix: switch un/clicked (since the change taking effect will serve as feedback already)
	- scene manager
		- central file to load scenes
		- can use global
			- list, index increments
			- dict, scene name : path
			- next scene button scene will pass no arguments (managed by global)
	- loading screen
		- integrate with next scene???
		- animations/effects
			- what if kuring's position on the water increases with progression?
		- implementation
			- global -> whenever a major scene loads
				- instance packed scene loading screen -> timer -> queue free
	- save system
		- at least major sections (ex. ilog story, gm battle)
		- via simple checkpoint system
	- global for all scene path files + switch scene fxn
